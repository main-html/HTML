<h1 align="center">Main HTML</h1>
Main HTML is an accessibility aware template putting users and web developers first. This makes your website into a living document through a collection of rules and interactive roles adapting the content delivery, inferred by behaviour and browser insights. Start your next project with a modern template that makes designing and building websites easier and faster. Leveraging server-less architecture for performance and millions of styling possibilities, you can build a small website in minutes or maintain a significant digital presence with Main.

The Main.HTML project provides you with a truly portable website builder template. Powered by Main.JS Under the hood!


## Main JS objective
The objective of Main JS is to deliver the best possible experience for website users, developers and website owners. 
To achieve this, Main JS creates a few easy to follow standards that when applied in web development, help streamline the complex processes of fetching resources, rendering layout, applying personalisation and measuring performance. 

This functionality is platform agnostic, accessibility aware and has no need for backend software packages, costly infrastructure or connectivity requirements.

### About the developer
This project has now merged with [Better Prompt](https://www.betterprompt.com/) [Rocket](https://github.betterprompt.com/Rocket) project and will continue development; see you there!

Copyright (C) 2025 **Andy Futcher**, I am the developer and maintainer of Main JS and Main HTML project and professional analyst at a not-for-profit health insurer.

Main JS is free and open source and will always be, my goal is to give everyone possible a first class ticket to the most well known and well-written markup language on earth; HTML. This is not just because of the projects chosen licence (GPLv3,) but it's a commitment to remain impartial and community focused and to never sell out or steer Main JS away from the core focus of portability and maintainability.
